Installation
============

*************
**  KDE4  ***
*************
Put this (extracted) folder in '~/.kde/share/icons/' (create the last folder "icons" if it doesn't exist; here '~' is your home). In some distros, the KDE4 settings directory may be '~/.kde4/' instead of '~/.kde/'.

Select Plataro in System Settings > Application Appearance > Icons and click Apply.

If you update the set, don't forget to recreate the icon cache by choosing another icon set in System Settings > Application Appearance > Icons, selecting Plataro again and clicking Apply.

*************
***  KF5  ***
*************
Put the extracted folder in '~/.local/share/icons/' and do as above.

*************
***  LXQT ***
*************
Put the extracted folder in '~/.icons/' ('~/.local/share/icons/' may work too) and select it from Configuration Center > Appearance > Icon theme.
